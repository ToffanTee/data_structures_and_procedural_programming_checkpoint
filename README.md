## Data structure and procedural programming

# Create an empty array newArray to store the combined array.

# Concatenate set1 and set2 into newArray.

# Initialize two variables arrTotal1 and arrTotal2 to 0.

# Iterate through set1: a. Iterate through set2: i. If the current element in set1 is equal to the current element in set2, add the sum of the two elements to arrTotal1.

# Iterate through newArray: a. Add the current element in newArray to arrTotal2.

# Calculate the difference sum between arrTotal2 and arrTotal1.

# Output the value of sum.
